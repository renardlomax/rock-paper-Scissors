# Rock Paper Scissors

Rock Paper Scissors is a classic game I rebuilt using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
I started this project to strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals, especially working with event listeners, conditionals, and DOM manipulation. What began as a small practice exercise is becoming a polished app that I can expand into a more complete portfolio project.
